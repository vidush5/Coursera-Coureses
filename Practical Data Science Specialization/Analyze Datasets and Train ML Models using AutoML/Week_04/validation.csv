__label__-1 "i was so excited about this top as the picture of the model it looks beautiful and drapey in just the right way . unfortunately this top feels like an old grandma 's polyester suit the sides are much shorter than the front & back and the combo of the inner lining and the outer fabric feels awkward with the inner piece being significantly shorter the the outer . it also puffed out a bit at the top of the shoulders in a strange way due to the layered fabric . sadly going back ."
__label__-1 "this looked like a simple chic blouse but the fabric felt cheap to me like thin lining fabric . the neckline is too deep and wide as well and so not flattering ."
__label__0 "really wanted to love this top ... it is beautiful with very good quality but ... ran small and tight ... also the bottom sides flare out as if it was stitched with too much material looking awkward ..."
__label__-1 "this is literally the most unflattering thing i have ever tried on from retailer . the sleeves are so weird and ugly . they get really fat at the top like a dolman sleeve but it looks really strange because they don ? t flow into the rest of the top which is very structured . it made my shoulders look huge even though i have very narrow shoulders . this is not apparent in the model picture at all . the thick black seams at the shoulders are also placed in a really awkward spot which also contri"
__label__0 "i so wanted to love this suit ! it is so unique and cute however it does not wear well on a short girl ! i am 54 and the torso was much too short for me so the cut down the middle looked really wide and odd and the suit just made me look stumpy instead of sexy . also for how expensive this suit it i also thought the material was pretty thin for how expensive this suit is . i 'm sad to say it is going back ."
__label__0 "i ordered the blue stripe and white in size large . i did n't like it worn off shoulder but it does stay in place which is a good thing . and it looks okay worn on the shoulders . i find the fabric so uncomfortable and itchy that i could n't wait to take it off immediately . i tried them on again a second time still hopeful with the same outcome . sadly returning ."
__label__1 "this coat is really beautiful and pictures do n't do it justice . it runs very large . i 'm normally an xl or l in sweaters but because of the balloony shape i actually took a medium - even then it looks like i 'm being enveloped so i prefer to wear it unsnapped ."
__label__-1 "for me this looked better in the picture . i found the actual item more garish in person and way too scratchy ( on the outside ) for my liking . hard pass for this petite ."
__label__0 "i love the way the mock neck style looks but the shirt is cut very small . i realize it 's supposed to stretch but it 's still very very tight on particularly in the shoulder area . if you like the style i 'd recommend sizing up ."

__label__0 "this dress is beautiful . the fabric is light weight but textured and interesting and the purple is gorgeous . the soft pink was a bit more orange than i expected but not a deal breaker . the problem i had with the dress was fit around the arms . i sized up and was glad that i did because it runs small up top but because the straps come in a bit around the arm holes it creates armpit fat which is not a problem i usually have . i could wear the dress with a sweater but you would n't be able to se"

__label__-1 "was so excited to get this dress because i thought it was cute and i love flowy and big dresses - however this looks huge . the material is not soft so it does n't fall well . it just stays proofed out so from the back you look like a giant ! !"

__label__0 "this dress is really attractive in terms of the pattern and the neckline . but the dealbreaker for me was the lack of darts in the back hip area -- so that the stretch fabric really hugs the full curve of your booty . a size larger gave me bagginess in the top and a still snug fit in back that i just did n't feel comfortable about . some darts could have made a nicer fit here . but this is a a great dress if you do n't mind a super body con fit ."
__label__0 "comfortable and soft material cute design and nice longer length .. however i 'm long waisted and this looked ridiculous on my me elastic came up right under my bra and not at my waist . would be cute for someone shorter ."

__label__0 "i like the quality of material of this top but it 's too long and wide for my frame . the high neck feels odd for my broad shoulders . too bad as i really wanted to love this ."
__label__-1 "i bought 3 shirts in gold black and red . they arrived larger than expected . after the first wash and air dry they shrunk . i would have been thrilled but they shrunk to be shorter while staying too wide . also my black shirt faded a lot with one wash ."

__label__-1 "would be flattering on someone who is slim with all the right curves . i 'm average size and a mother of 3. the medium was not a true medium . the fabric was amazing . the arm holes were too open/low cut for my taste . i 'm 5 ' 7 and 140. this landed mid calf . not my preference . retailer accepted the return with a hassel free refund all under 2 weeks from receiving it ."
__label__1 "i initially ordered a small but found it looked way more oversized then what it should look like even considering the style . ( i was swimming in fabric ! ) i exchanged it for a petite small and it fit perfectly . it goes so well with so many looks and it is going to last a long while in my rotation . looks much better in person too . my only reservation is that unlike the original one i received this one had many threads loose throughout which i clipped and think will be alright but i expected"

__label__-1 "was n't crazy about this top . it looked great online but in person it 's just a boring and lifeless top ."
__label__0 "i loved the color of these but they bagged out with just one wear . they are going back to store ."
__label__0 "i had high hopes for this jumpsuit for a holiday party but it is a very odd fit . i 'm normally a 10-12 preferably a petite . i ordered this in a large and i could n't begin to zip it up . it also ran extremely short in the crotch area . very pretty print but it 's going back !"
__label__-1 "as others have said this is cropped so will look funny with most pants that are n't high waisted . i 'm going to try it with a few dresses before i return it . the lining is adorable so i do n't want to have to send it back ."
__label__1 "this is a beautiful piece - but not if you need a hardy sweater . the material is lovely as are the two colors i saw . but it is lightweight and delicate . i tried an xxxs petite which is my norm and it fit perfectly . i did not buy it as for the price and relative usefulness i had to say no . i will watch for sale ."
__label__-1 "i really like the look of the top when it is photographed on other people but it just is n't for me . the fabric is stiffer than i would have expected and not very moveable . the fit is not quite right on me . the longer sleeves detract from the look of the shirt . i also generally prefer things a little more form fitting of which this is not . it was not very comfortable for me either so this was clearly not a win for me ."
__label__1 "i saw this online and ended up driving over an hour to pick it up from a neighboring retailer store that had 1 more left in my size ! it fits true to size for me with the waist band fitting my 27 inches perfectly with no real give- so keep that in mind . the top does seem a little blousey which i typically avoid ( 34d already ) but this was still super flattering . overall it is a gorgeous dress that looks good on- one of those dresses that makes you feel good wearing it !"
__label__0 "cute details but not happy with the fit . runs wide and short . the peplum fabric on bottom is stiff wrinkles easily and lays funny . returning this one ."
__label__1 "fit is true to size color is accurate . love the feel of the knit it 's weightier than if anticipated . i 'm looking forward to wearing this to my pnw trips ."
__label__-1 "i loved the aesthetic but as a true hourglass shape i was frustrated that it did n't have a little more give as i tried to pull it over my head . the fabric was stiff and seemed to be lace over cotton ? not entirely sure . i could n't get past the feeling off the material ."
__label__0 "i ordered this and did n't even try it on when it came . the color was not as i expected ... it had pinkish undertones and it just was n't what i was looking for as far as color . also the fabric is very thin not like the other two tunic dresses i have ordered recently from retailer ( toscana tunic & sandscape swing dress ) . it was also easy to see that this runs large . oh well thought i might have one more fresh summer tunic dress to throw on in a flash but i 'm happy with the other two ( i was finally a"
__label__0 "not sure about this yet . reordered larger size because it hits much higher than shown . belly peeked out from under it ! ordered 6 and i 'm normally a small/6 . like the design but really short ."
__label__0 "i read the reviews and everyone loved them so ordered them online . for me they are a no . i thought the fabric was cheap and the quality not so great compared to typical retailer items ."
__label__0 "nice quality and feel to the fabric but they are super lightweight and do not come down to the ankle . they fall at a strange place on the calf - a better cropped summer pant perhaps ."
__label__1 "i also agree that this piece ran very small . my normal size did not zip up . i sized up a size and it pulled across my thighs . i sized up two sizes and it fit as i had hoped it would . if you get the right size it is beautiful on . the colors are so fun and i love the side slit . i bought it to wear to work with a blouse or blazer and it is definitely a statement piece ."
__label__-1 "really wanted to like this and took chances based on other reviews even with the sale price and addtl discount . it 's basically $ 30 blouse fabric with design and detail-work of a much more expensive blouse . the white is sheer and and fabric will wrinkle easily . if it were black you could probably get away with it but the white shows too many flaws and will wrinkle . sad to have to send it back ."
__label__1 "i bought this as a gift for a friend that is getting married in a few months . it 's so soft and cozy i 'm tempted to keep it ! i got the xs/s regular in white and was worried it would be too long but hits my natural waist ( belly button ) and i 've got a shorter torso and am 5 ' 4.5 . i got this during the 40 % sweater sale and feel it is worth the full price . a fun piece but not one to keep you warm on a cold night more of a cab to curb piece ."

__label__0 "runs a little small in the shoulders/bust"

__label__1 "perfect fit . this dress is super flattering the criss-crossing fabric at the bust looks awesome on . the fabric is a little bit thicker through there which is nice for coverage . the skirt is light and airy and the pattern is so pretty ! the perfect spring to summer dress !"
__label__1 "beautiful dress but i had to returned because the size large was a little big"
__label__1 "i love this top ! although it is a tad big i expected this because the moth brand usually does run a tad big . however i am still able to wear it without any nerves that it 's too big .... hope that makes sense ! the navy was more lovely with my skin + hair but the yellow was so pretty too !"

__label__-1 "i have to agree that the fit is unfortunate . i am using a size 2 in retailer and most dresses . i knew to size up based on reviews here . i tried the size 4 and i could barely button the top . the waist fit fine and the underarms was fitted nicely to the body . i sized up to a size 6 and the dress was oversized in the top with gaping armholes . too bad because the color is beautiful and the style is adorable ."
__label__-1 "this is a gorgeous top . very well made with a classy design . it fits true to size from the lower chest up . however at about the mid-belly range the shirt widens out and basically allows a 5 month twin pregnancy to comfortably fit in . size xs . i was so sad . for the price i ca n't justify taking it for alterations . it would have been the perfect top ."

__label__0 "this wears nicely and is true to photo . flattering in the waist and on a petite everything fell in the right places . i also like the lightweight creppy skirt fabric . just one design note - the tie is sort of strange . essentially there 's a long tube of fabric coming out of each side of the bust - and it looks very odd when the ties are undone ."
__label__-1 "i ordered this in cream during the 25 % sale . i had seen one at the store and thought it was very pretty but it was not my size so i did n't try it on . when it arrived it was a wrinkled mess . it was so wrinkled that i do n't think i would be able to iron it satisfactorily . i was also disappointed in the fabric of the dress layer . it almost looked flocked and i wonder if something is wrong with this dress in particular . it was also way too short for me . i 'll be taking it back very soon . i do plan"
__label__-1 "the dress is too loose and runs too big"
__label__0 "as other reviewers have noted the fit of this tee is very boxy . it looks okay tucked-in to high waisted jeans but otherwise is unflattering . also the color is described as black but mine looks like a navy blue in person . i kept the shirt because i live overseas and returning it would have been difficult but if able to i would have returned it ."
__label__-1 "the length in the front is too short and the bottom flares a lot which is really unflattering . i love the top half of the shirt but the bottom half should be more form fitting ."
__label__-1 "i was so looking forward to an awesome maxi dress . this was not it . completely see through . i guess you could wear it as a bathing suit cover up . but be prepared to knot the length or you will trip . its an odd design . absolutely not worth the price . i purchased the sm/md and i could have for two of me in the dress . returned this piece without looking back"
__label__1 "i had been looking for a green jacket with a hood just like this one and was thrilled to find it . i found the fit to be true to size . i am 5 ' 4 107 pounds and i bought the xs which is my usual size in retailer jackets . i love the material and the way it hangs so casually ."
__label__1 "i am so in love with this top . can be worn on or off the shoulders . the color is amazing !"

__label__0 "i finally ordered this at this incredible mark downed price ... but i see why . it is cute but serious size issues i have a bust but smaller everywhere else but i did order up because of it being a jumpsuit ... i would have needed 6 more to even zip the top part ! i have many trendy jumpsuits in my closet and this is a first ! if you are flat chested you may want to try at this great price as it would be a great piece for sitting by the fireside next fall/winter ... never too soon to plan ahead !"
__label__0 "i bought these pants in white and tan . they are comfortable and fit great.however they tend to stretch . i just got them and they are already starting to become uncomfortably loose . i still really like them but i recommend you buy a little tight so they become comfortable ."

__label__0 "they are beautiful in person until you put the on . the fit was a bit weird ; tighter in the waist roomy in the crotch . the fabrics work 100 % against one another . the vegan leather especially the detail pieces at the outer side seams is too stiff . the back is thin and has far too much elasticity . at $ 150 i passed . these will only enter my closet on sale ."
__label__1 "this skirt is so cute ! ! highly recommend super easy to dress up or to dress down . it is n't shown as well in the picture but it has really intricate and pretty detailed stitching throughout the skirt . i have gotten so many compliments on it random people have even stopped to tell me how much they like it and where they can find it . it runs a little small so i recommend buying it a size up . also if you 're taller like me it is a little short in the back . overall a great buy !"
__label__1 "i fell in love with this as soon as i tried it on . it does n't look nearly as good on the hanger so definitely worth trying on . the fabric is high quality and super comfy ; the fit is very flattering . i am curvy 5 ' 7 and got the navy stripe print in size small . it 's very forgiving fitted without clinging to any problem areas . i also love how versatile it is -- you can wear it as a dress as shown on the models or as a tunic over tight jeans or jeggings/leggings . love it !"
__label__1 "i wanted these leggings to wear under dresses during winter to keep my legs warm . they get the job done and for an incredible price . they are soft and lined with fleece on the inside . i 'm not sure the ribbing on the black is necessary but it 's subtle and i do n't mind it . they are a tad long on my petite frame but since i intend to tuck them into boots the length not a problem . my only quibble is that my first pair arrived with three snags on one leg . retailer kindly sent me a new pair for"

__label__-1 "this dress is cuter is person than online but it has one huge issue - there is a teeny tiny button at the neck that is held on by a thread and requires fingers the size of a two year old to get open . it fell off the minute i tried to undo it . i ca n't believe these other reviewers did n't have the same problem . or maybe they put a snap there instead . too bad ."

__label__0 "this is a lightweight knit dress that is well-designed but very form-fitting . i decided to return it because at almost 40 there are parts of my body that i do n't need to show but if you 're in great shape or willing to wear shape wear this would be super cute ."
__label__1 "this is great soft sweater that is not to bulky looking.sometimes when you have a design like this it looks good off but when you put it on it makes you look like a stuffed marshmallow . this sweater 's knit is thin enough that when you add the accents it looks less bulky . wore it with winter white pants and received many compliments ."

__label__1 "i purchased this dress in the berry color . it is beautiful and feminine . the length fit just like in the picture . i love all the detail and ease of this dress . i 'm 5 ' 2 34d and purchased a size 2. it fits true to size ."

__label__0 "i love the simplicity and modernity of this tunic ; however the pockets ruin it if that 's possible . they make the dress bulky around the hips . i usually wear an 8 or medium and i ordered this dress in a medium . i think this brand runs a little small . the bulky pocket issue may be solved with a larger size . the weight of the fabric is a little heavy which prevents year-round wear . i love the subtle texture . one odd thing the tag is attached to the stand-up collar . i had my hair up when i tried"

__label__1 "i absolutely love this cardigan ! it is so soft and goes with anything . it can be dressed up or down . it is definitely my new go to for airplane travels . highly recommend ! !"

__label__-1 "oh such a classic retailer look for summer ! a vintage pattern on a crisp cotton fabric . i was immediately drawn to it . but wait- there is a sort of wrap around tie at the waist creating the look of an apron . yes . it looks like one is wearing a full apron . or scrub dress . why ? ? this would have been sooo much better as a simple shift or a skirt/blouse combo ."
__label__1 "i really liked this tank . i purchased it in the green . i went with my regular size 2. yes it 's boxy but it 's a nice tank that will get lots of use this summer . i 'm planning on using it on our vacation to the beach . it is thin and soft ."
__label__0 "this dress is most definitely not a maxi ! barely goes below the knees . also you do not get the cute detail shown on bodice . there are no folds which were an added plus on picture . waist is higher not at natural waist . very pretty silk though and still cute . just not as pictured ."
__label__1 "this is beautiful tunic for the spring and summer . great paired with jeans or white denim . runs large and is a true tunic length . very pretty fabric and built in camisole too . only downside is that it probably needs to be hand washed/line dried to keep it looking like new ."
__label__-1 "i 'm happy the other reviewers made this dress work because it looked terrible on me . i 'm 5 9 and 128 lbs and it made me look like i had gained 25 lbs . as others have said the pockets make the dress even worse-it 's very hard to get them to lay flat . the material is lovely soft and i liked the gray color but this dress made me feel like i was wearing something from an asylum ."
__label__1 "i loved the mustard colored version of this skirt for summer and was thrilled to see it reissued in darker hues . same comfortable fit and cool textured fabric that does n't wrinkle . i found the regular sizing to still be above the knee and the wide elastic waistband great for either a cropped top or a belt . will wear often ."
__label__1 "these pants are adorable . i am a petite lady with a small waist and have a hard time finding pants that fit and look good but these do . they are both cute and elegant . and they have pockets . i have had many compliments . the one drawback is they need dry cleaning ."
__label__-1 "i really like this dress/shirt . it 's great for layering super cute and will hide my traditional holiday and this year 's pregnancy weight gain . i think it will be so cute with some leggings and boots . unfortunately the back panel of the dress does not seem to vary based on the size . this may sound weird but i 've tried on an 8 and a 10 and the ability to reach forward did n't change between the two sizes . i just returned the 10 and am hopeful the 12 i ordered will be slightly roomier in the back ."
__label__-1 "i 'm 5 ' 3 about 130lbs and ordered a size 6. the print on the fabric is as expected but the shape of the dress and fit were not good at all . i probably would wear a 4 instead of the 6 but could tell that even if i had the 4 the cut of it still would n't be flattering on me at all . it was baggy in odd places and had no shape . the outer fabric is very sheer and see through and the lining is nice with a fitted slip design ."
__label__-1 "i really loved the way this shirt looked on me . it 's forgiving and flattering and really lightweight . the fabric however could n't even withstand half a day 's wear without snagging 3 times and developing a hole right in the center . i have no idea how this happened as i was n't wearing or near anything that could have pulled at it . such a shame . this could have been a staple wardrobe piece for me ."
__label__-1 "i wanted to love this sweater . the lavender color and design with the pleated back was beautiful . however when i put it on it added at least 20 pounds to my frame . unfortunately it 's going back since the cut just does n't work on my frame ."
__label__1 "i 'm glad i listened to the other reviewers ... i ordered a large instead of my usual medium . it 's roomy enough for a sweater underneath . i love the denim ! it 's very soft and has some stretch . my other denim jackets are stiff even after years of washing . i also love the darker denim ."
__label__1 "i love this top . the quality is excellent . the blouse is lined and falls nicely .. i like to wear it with a pair of dark gray jeans . the color is described as orange but it really has more of a bronze tone . looks very rich and exotic . it 's perfect top when you want to wear jeans but want to dress it up a bit ."
__label__-1 "this skirt is very short . i ordered my usual xs petite and it was so short that the longest part ended above my ankle . that 's quite off because i 'm only 5 feet tall and i wore it pretty low on the hips . it also flares out awkwardly below the knee . there are 2 vertical seems and they exacerbate the jagged appearance of the hem . i was drawn to the edgy style shown in the photo but in person it looks like my 5 year old cut up a skirt . plus the fabric -- while thick and beautiful and stretchy -- has a"
__label__1 "this . an unexpected purchase ... i found this on my way to the dressing room . the fit is stunning . i sized way down ( i.e . normally wear 10/12 curvy and bought a small ) . it accentuates my curves and is incredibly flattering . i bought the navy and will be adding another color soon ! the material is viscose blend - soft and flowy . it 's a nice addition to my work wardrobe ."
__label__0 "i was so disappointed when i received this top . the color is some washed-out faded version of the picture shown and the cut is much fuller than it looks in the picture . the back is cute but not worth the awful drab actual color ."
__label__-1 "i was extremely excited to receive these pants given the two positive reviews . i 'm a petite woman and have trouble finding jeans with the right proportions . i sized down from my normal size ( 27 to a 26 ) and was swimming in these pants . i would have had to go down three sizes to make these work . i 'm not sure if i received a defective pair or what but be cautious ordering these pants ."
__label__-1 "this is a very soft and comfortable jacket but it has holes in the pocket area . it was returned to the store and the other jackets had the same problem although not in the same area . the store was considering pulling the product off their shelves . it is unclear if the holes are just the beginning of a pocket or what . but it was flawed by everyone who looked at it ."
__label__-1 "very disappointed : runs small in chest and too long . the fabric is cheap but the print is pretty with the bead and flower detail . i do n't think this dress is worth the price it is not even silk and the underlay feels like cheap gauze . i have been in the fashion industry for over 30 years and this is a miss mark in my opinion . put it back on the rack and save your $ for something better at sweet retailer !"
__label__-1 "the colors in this dress are beautiful ( the green/blue version ) but the fabric is a very see through mesh and feels flimsy . i purchased it online and was n't expecting it to be so sheer -- the particular empire cut combined with the fabric makes it feel more like a nightgown i really wanted to love it but it 's going back ."
__label__0 "the fabric of this skirt is absolutely beautiful . however the fit albeit unique is not extremely flattering in my opinion . it may be because i am somewhat of a pear/hourglass shape rather than a more straight shape but the fit is a little off imo . i am 5 ' 8 and 135 # and ordered both the 6 & 8 and felt the 8 fit a little better ."

__label__-1 "usually wear s and xs tried this in s at store but the sides were still lumpy after zipping the size zipper up . if i tried xs it would have looked better but may be bit too tight . the sides of the arm holes were also cut very low . it also has a dusty grey sheen to it that makes it look like old velvet in a bad way . two layers green on outside and a polyester beige layer underneath . but definitely a showpiece that can be paired with a short jacket ."
__label__1 "i was a bit unsure when ordering because of the cut of this blouse . i have a lean athletic torso but i am a 32dd . sometimes tops like this can make me look heavy or pregnant . love the fit though . it fits lovely and comfy . it goes well with jeans or cream colored pants and will be a nice addition to my spring wardrobe ."
__label__0 "i agree with some of the other reviewers ; this dress runs very large . when i tried on the xs in my local store i loved the color and thought i could work with it with the right bra or camisole but it was just cut far too low in the front and when i tried it on at home it was just too roomy and not fitted enough . i ordered both an xsp and an xxs today so we will see if they fit better . it is an adoreable design cut and color . it just runs way big so size down if you decide to get it ."
__label__0 "i absolutely love the look and fit of these jeans . i did have to size down . i ran into problems after washing . the fraying on one leg was twice that of the other looking very unbalanced . after looking closely i found that one leg had a top stitching very close to the fray to prevent further fraying . the other leg did not have this stitching thus the fraying double in size . i have sent a request to customer service for a replacement pair . these are adorable jeans just be sure to check for stitc"

__label__1 "very cute . i received many compliments when i wore it . fits true to size ( petite 2 ) with some good stretch in it . i am 5 ' 3 and it was slightly longer than that on the model . it is a little odd that the buttons are all not the same . but perhaps that is part of its charm and it is not noticeable . it is very comfortable and the pictures are representative of what it looks like ."
__label__0 "i loved this sweater when i bought it . wore it a couple times then washed it according to the tag . it shrunk at least two sizes ! and the tassels got all tangled ( which i guess i should have seen coming ) . pretty bummed about it because this sweater looked beautiful on ."
__label__0 "i received the vest and it was pretty much as pictured however the color is n't quite yellow ; it has a little green to it kind of chartreuse . i returned the item because it did n't look as good on me as it did on the pictured model . this would probably look better on someone taller than me ."
__label__0 "i 'm pretty tan and i always have to be careful with white tops or pants . i love the embroidery detail but this top is practically see-through for me . it is double-lined but i could still see my bra . very pretty though and i was disappointed that it did n't work for me ."
__label__-1 "i was not a fan of these leggings . these were very unflattering . i could see that after wearing these all day they could start stretch out . i just did n't feel like they would hold up for even one season ."

__label__-1 "i grabbed my typical size ( 8 ) and found it fit snug in the bust . the fabric has plenty of stretch so the snugness was fine especially because it meant there was no gaping along the neckline in the front . it 's lowcut but i did n't feel particularly exposed . i ended up not buying it because i do n't think it fit my body right . the distance between the top of the shoulder and the bottom of the arm hole was too long for me - a significant portion of my bra was exposed at the bottom of the arm hole"

__label__0 "i loved how the skirt looked on the model but when i tried in on it had no shape on me . i usually wear a size 6 and received a size 4 which was large on me . also the material feels rough which i was not expecting as it is advertised as a silk skirt . i was really looking forward to wearing this skirt but it is just not i thought it was - i expect better quality from retailer ."

__label__1 "i ordered the cream . the fabric is unique . similar to a waffle but with a dressy quality . you definitely need a cami or tank underneath . its form fitting without being too snug . i like to wear it with distressed jeans front tucked in and kind of ruched to hide my middle ( my trouble spot ) with chunky accessories belt necklace and a block heel . it 's a little pricey but decided worth it ."
__label__0 "gorgeous but just too short in length for anyone with a long torso . i sized up to get more length but then the neck opening was way too big and hung open to expose - well everything up top . wearing a cami would be an option but would take away from the dressiness of the top . i had to leave without this item but was disappointed because i love the colors and cut otherwise !"

__label__1 "this sweatshirt is the perfect solution to chilly mornings or evenings . sundry 's lightweight fleece is never too warm or cool . the fit is true to size . the short sleeves look even cuter rolled up once or twice . i know i will be getting a lot of use from this top once early summer comes along !"
__label__0 "i was so excited to finally find a work appropriate contemporary pant that i wore them about 3 times in the first week . needless to say they needed to be washed and i followed the care instructions by washing in cold water and laying flat to dry . after just a single wash in cold water the pants faded to the point that they looked like they were three years old . so sad luckily retailer took them back without a problem . be warned these may need to be dry cleaned which is a lot of maintena"
__label__0 "this is a very sweet/soft sweater however it runs very large and is very boxy ! i would say at least size down 1-2 sizes ! i wanted to love them but i had to send it back ! !"
__label__1 "i bought this top about 3 weeks ago & love it ! i like it because it 's better than a plain t-shirt so it 's perfect for running around doing errands or shopping . i like the material and the length i 'm 5 ' 8 and sometimes i feel like shirts are to short . i wash it and hang it to dry no shrinking or pilling so far ! i am ordering this in at least two more colors !"
__label__1 "i ordered this dress to wear for a rehearsal dinner . i almost consistently wear a medium in most clothing but for this picked the large because of my height . i was for sure it would be too short in any other size . when i put it on i was drowning in it ! i would definitely order the small if i had the time before the rehearsal . has the potential to be super cute and flattering yet the timing and sizing did n't work out . definitely give this one a try !"
__label__0 "this top is beautiful in the model shot but average in person . it ran really small i usually take a medium in retailer tops and ordered this in a medium . it barely fit over my chest and was pretty short ( i am 5 ' 7 ) . also the material is very thin not so much that you can see your undergarment but if you get cold everyone will know it . also for the price i expected a sturdier fabric . i would recommend holding out for sale if you are interested in this top ."
__label__0 "beautifully made . beautiful drape . deep blue . so long tho i have to role it up at the waist so nix on tucking a white blouse in . why is it so long ? ? ? ? in 5 ' 6 and got a large . with 2 inch heels i still trip and not about to wear really high herls . ill keep it tho because its a nuce dressy skirt . may take it to be hemmed but the last item i got hemmed ended up an uneven mess"
__label__-1 "this top is crazy in the front and just way-off when it comes to a cross-over drape . the top did not lay flat and the drape over has one snap which seemed to bloop open constantly . the bottom in the front is a strange combination of layers that i could n't get to look good . i 'm busty but this is n't the reason this blouse is just a disaster of a fit on me . the blouse fits tts and everything was covered so it 's not like it was too small and tugged . that 's not the case . this blouse just did n't"
__label__-1 "i loved the fact that this dress is cotton . it is a thin cotton and you can see in the photos that she is wearing a black slip with a thicker strap . mine came with a nude slip . i 'm thinking they all come with a nude slip . i 'm not sure why they showed the dress with the black thick strap slip unless it was to show the dress as a thicker cotton than what it actually is . the dress is adorable though which makes it hard for me to decide whether to keep it and hope mine wo n't tear easily or to retur"
__label__-1 "i was really looking forward to receiving this blouse in the mail . the color was beautiful in person and the photo does not show the nice beading around the neck . that being said i was so disappointed in the fit . i ordered a size 00 and the arm length was way too long yet the body of the shirt was way too cropped . cropped enough where you could see skin on the sides . made no sense ! hoping to order a few more sizes to see if i can find the right fit . order up for length down for arm length ..."
__label__-1 "i 'm baffled why none of the other reviewers have mentioned how large these pants are . i ordered the petite small and i 'm always a small . these are huge . i felt like i had on a large . i like the thin material and color and i 'm sad that they are so large ."
__label__-1 "i truly can not understand the great reviews on this dress ! i purchased in both a sp and a mp . i am 5 ' 2 120 # . the mp fit perfectly . i definitely would n't keep it though because it looks like someone sewed a bunch of old sweatshirts together . it 's not super soft coarse on the inside and feels old . the back is longer than the front it just looks like something my daughter would make in sewing class out of scraps . even with leggings and great boots it looks worn ."
__label__0 "i had high hopes for these as coh is my favorite brand of denim and these crops were made specifically for petites . also i was happy to see they were described as a straight jean not a skinny . the fit and sizing seems to be a little off . i ordered my regular size in this brand 27p but they were too big . sized down to a 26p . they were still too large in the waist ( seemed very stretchy ) but fit well in the legs . i like the fact that these crops were made for petites so the length was perfect"
__label__1 "beautiful feminine flowy dress . love the brass button detail at neckline and around waist-gives the otherwise delicate dress a pop of edge . had to detach the slip to get it on but glad it is included with the dress . i purchased the small and fits like a glove ( 5 ' 8 135lbs 34d ) . ca n't wait to wear it ! !"
__label__1 "i bought this dress because i love the cut-out shoulder look and had been wanting to find something with this trend that i 'd feel comfortable wearing . the dress fits well and the shoulder cut-out gives it a trendy look . i love the classic navy color . i was originally hesitant to buy it because of the slub material - which i 've always thought to be a cheaper thin cotton . the slub is more substantial than other slub tops i 've seen elsewhere so i was happy about that . still it is made with slub"
__label__1 "crazy soft and comfy . light weight so will be great for spring/ summer and layering . so happy i bought it ."
__label__0 "i had a few pairs of these high-waisted beauties last year and love them so i was thrilled to see them in this adorable pattern which is even cuter in person . unfortunately the cut is different . the sides covered here by the model 's hands flare out a bit which is the function of the sectioning that the piping accentuates . the top is not the definitively high-wasted height from last year . i do n't own anything else high-wasted being an apple i 'm generally a low-rider owing to a small hips/butt"
__label__0 "recommend this vest - nice design - fabric is thicker than expected - might suggest a size smaller - plenty of room in loose styling"
__label__-1 "from the photos i thought the design was embroidered . in reality it is stamped on . there is a tiny bit of embroidery and a few sequins but overall the design is just printed on the fabric . i did n't feel it looked good in fact it looked kind of cheap to me so i returned it . the overall style of the jacket was great and it would have looked equally good for work or casual . i was disappointed it did n't work out ."
__label__-1 "this one did n't work for me . ordered this and the riverdeck tee as similar vein . riverdeck was cute and flattering cut . this one was boxy on me and did n't work . a bit too wide so sending back ."
__label__1 "love the lace on the back ! it 's a sweet take on a typical tee ! comfy ! a little on the boxier side but a great tee ."
__label__-1 "very disappointed when i received this . the colors and ombre fabric are beautiful . beading and embroidery make it a even more unique top however the shape ruins all of that . first it is nearly a crop top . second it is boxy and it 's attempt to be a swing top only makes it bulky . third need to size down 2 sizes . had to return this ."
__label__1 "i absolutely love these pants ! i have been searching for a pair of linen pants for quite a few years but have never really found a pair that looked good on me until now . i have usually found linen pants to lack shape and end up making me look frumpy but i really love the fabric . well these pants actually have some structure to them and are still super comfy and soft . i bought the neutral color which is acutually a very fine tan and white pinstripe which makes the pants a bit more classy . i love"
__label__1 "i got this for my girlfriend and was happy they had additional sizes online as we were not able to find this in the store . we loved that this could be worn stand alone with leggings or as an over-shirt . it 's very versatile and is perfect for your fall wardrobe ."
__label__-1 "although this has a nice design and i wanted to love it it already looked ruined in the store with pulls all over each one i found . the fit is nice but i would n't buy it due to the material being too delicate ."
__label__-1 "the title says it all . while the quality was good when i put this dress on a felt like i was wearing a shapeless sack fashioned out of wallpaper . the length was longer than on the model ( makes sense since i am only 5 ' 5 ) which was ok but the overall fit was just too big . i am a size 2 and tried the xs which was huge . just not flattering or breezy or sexy in any way . going back !"
__label__1 "i purchased this top on 2 colors ... a great go to .... stylish soft and very comfortable ."
__label__-1 "the small zipped and laid flat measures 16 across at the bottom of the armholes 11 at the waist and 18 from shoulder seam to bottom edge . it 's too small for a size 0 and not by just a little ! too bad because it really is very pretty ."
__label__1 "i picked this dress up to take into the dressing room to try on without looking at the price tag . im typically a small and he dress in store was an xs but because of the wrap i figured i 'd try it anyway . this dress is to die for ! the xs fit me just fine ( though the snap at the chest would n't stay closed but i thought it looked ok ) . i looked at the tag after falling in love with the dress but left the store without it . i 'm contemplating purchasing it still because i ca n't stop thinking about it ! !"
__label__1 "i have come to scoop up basically ever elevenses jumpsuit that they release because they are perfection - always the perfect fit and quality fabric . i 'm on the taller side at 5 ' 7 and found this to fit perfectly yet somehow it looks equally as perfect on shorter ladies i saw in the dressing room . awesome !"
__label__0 "this is a very comfortable shirt great basic to have in the wardrobe it runs a little high on the sides"
__label__0 "just received pants and even though they are labeled petite they are not . the inseam is 28 for a waist size 26 which is not what the description states ."
__label__-1 "this sweater is very long could be worn as a dress at 5 ' 3 !"
__label__0 "according to the sizing chart i should be an 8 or 10. i ordered a 10 but i could not get the blouse zipped up around the ribcage the one spot i do n't keep any fat . i brought it to the store to exchange for a 12 but i could n't breath with the 12 on . for reference i am 34ddd . it was the 34 part that did n't fit the ddd would have fit fine i think ."
__label__1 "the lengths is what drew me to this top . i love the simple look of the cowl neck . nice detail to the sleeve that creates a more than casual look ."
__label__1 "the fit on this dress is super flattering ! i am not normally able to wear a sheath but i felt great in this one . i am definitely a pear shape bigger on the bottom than the top . one of the things i really love about this dress is that the size that fits me through the hips fits me on top . this is not often the case . i am not sure how this would work on someone with a large bust or an apple body type but i felt great in it . i also love the colors . i bought the green and blue . i have worn it once"
__label__-1 "i really wanted to love this dress . it is absolutely beautiful - the color design and details . however whether it is the high neckline or the sleeves it did nothing for me and made me look kinda frumpy . though i am slender i have a chest . maybe that was the problem ."
__label__1 "absolutely love this top ! i 've been on the lookout for a cute cotton top something that 'd be ideal for summertime . this beautiful piece does n't disappoint . the color pairing - white cotton base and lovely red thread embroidery - looks stunning . not the mention the unique back detailing makes it a must-have . highly recommend ."
__label__1 "this skirt is stunning but i really wish it was cotton canvas - maybe by summer retailer could make one ?"
__label__1 "i love this top . it was cool on a summers day . i did get one of the strings of the design snagged but it worked out just fine not ruined at all ."
__label__-1 "the zipper broke on this piece the first time i wore it . very disappointing since i love the design . i 'm actually going to try to replace the zipper myself with something stronger but annoying that it 's come to that ."
__label__-1 "i wanted to love this jumpsuit . it looks adorable in the product photo . i am 5 ' 5 about 120lbs and thus was overwhelming on me . i tried everything -- - pulling up the tie at the waist to create a higher line wearing a variety of heel heights -- -- i could n't seem to make it work . there was just so much fabric on me ! it felt like i was wearing pajamas ( and not in a cute 'wear your pajamas out ' way ) . i love the idea and the photo appears to have an adorable line and cut . on me this jumpsuit was just"
__label__0 "first this sweater drapes beautifully and has a unique look . however there are several items to note . primarily this sweater is very expensive . the wool has an itchy feel . the & quot ; drape & quot ; is a second layer under the cardigan so it creates a liner but it is not sewn in at the bottom . so it is annoying when you first put it on . it is at least sewn in on the inside of the cardigan at the top . i also notice that the seams are sewn white or are falling apart already on the sleeves ."
__label__-1 "what a disappointment and for the price it 's outrageous !"
__label__1 "i love the color of this top . it is a dark olive green and elegant . i mostly wear it under a blazer with my jeans . it fits true to size and the smocking detail is casual and elegant at the same time ."
__label__-1 "i ordered the black & white 00 petite . i 'm 5 ' 2 96 lbs . and i order petite sizes all the time . the length for the size i ordered is about 23 ( on the back from neckline ) which is great for me ; however the length on the sides is way too short . the distance between the armpit on the blouse and the side hem is only 9.25 so my skin shows on the sides all the time when wearing regular jeans . not at all the way it shows on the model . i would order 00 regular length but then the sleeves will b"
__label__-1 "quality was not what you expect from retailer especially for the price . top is lined but skirt is not . material is tissue paper thin and see thru . there is a point at the bottom of the sweetheart neckline that does not lay flat it keeps popping up . however the back is very cute and for that i wanted to love it but too many negatives . was returned ."

__label__-1 "i saw this at the store today . very excited about it but i had no idea how to get it on ! there is a side zipper so i attempted to step into the jumper through the collar but could never get my arms through ! from what i could see on my body it would have been too short in the crotch . i decided not to fight with it to put on entirely . i gave up . cute shade of green though ."
__label__0 "i really wanted to love this . i kept refreshing the page so that i could order it as soon as my size was in stock . i love the colors and struggle to find cute dresses in natural fabrics for the summer . unfortunately as another reviewer mentioned the cut of the arm holes is strange . it cut my off in the most unflattering spot ."
__label__0 "i was so excited to find this dress in the store ! i immediately headed for the dressing room to try this beauty on .... what a disappointment . the fabric is stunning but the fit is extremely voluminous . i am normally a small to medium so i grabbed a small ...... the only way to describe this dress is tentlike ! it was huge from the waist down . i do n't think i could size to an xs because i am a 34d and the top half of the dress fit perfect ! i was sad to leave the store without this dress ."
__label__1 "perfect fit nice detailing best feature is that they do not bag out after wearing for a short time . good lines in back so they are more dressy than a regular legging ."
__label__0 "i love the metallic colors of this top and figured i could wear it under a ruched jacket and circle skirt for work . welp that 's out the window . this design is poor . for one this is not a piece for a petite woman with no torso and i do n't know how anyone with a longer torso wears t his . this hits above my belly botton on and i got apetite 2. i have no torso . so without a jacket i would never wear this . it 's very low cut .. the back is very low .. it 's a little loose but i run between a 2 and a 4 ."
__label__-1 "i love the pattern adn color combo but wow t really flatering on me . too much fabric . i felt like i was trying to hide wight gain or pregnancy or wearing a mumu . anyway not for me but others might toll wnat to try in case it was just me ... too bad . length was decent in regulat size though not too long . just too wide ."
__label__1 "i love this dress ! it is beyond flattering ! i tried the south shore dress on earlier this year but found it too short for my taste . this however .. is the same cut on top but longer in the skirt ! yes please ! i purchased the turquoise which is exactly as pictured ! just beautiful ! hits at my shins . for reference i 'm 5 ' 6 136 lbs and ordered a size small ."
__label__-1 "description is wrong . not a swing tunic . more long and straight . keep that in mind when buying this . if you have hips this might not be the top for you"
__label__0 "love the idea of this but it ran short and boxier than i would have liked . material is soft cute design but not flattering . returning"
__label__-1 "definitely agree with the other reviewers . this top looks great on the model but pretty bad in real life . super boxy and has no give so everything just hangs . if you plan on ordering i 'd recommend sizing down ."
__label__-1 "i loved the design and look to this shirt but it ran way big for me . i loved the forgiving fit but it just was n't flattering at all . i even went down one size and it still was huge . sad to send this one back ."
__label__1 "these leggings are very comfortable with a bit of control . i ordered the m and they fit perfectly as usual i do have to tuck the hem up just a bit but i have to do that with all my leggings . i love the laser cut detail on the side which is a lavender color ."
__label__-1 "... for the model to look like this ? pros : nice quality . the colors of the blue version at least are rich and beautiful . note that the dark color pictured is really brown not black . the colors are also much brighter than they appear in the picture . it is a medium to heavy weight sweater knit which is well suited for fall-winter . it is layered over a bright navy poly slip . cons : i am 5 ' 8 135 # . i looked like i was wearing a circus tent in med . the sleeves were more dolman than fitted . i imagin"
__label__0 "i like everything about this shirt except i wish the embroidery was on the back too . gives it a cheaper look by only having it on the front . you will look prettier coming than going for sure !"
__label__0 "i should have exchanged it for a smaller size but i wanted to wear it so my mistake . i tend to wear size 12-14 and the large is entirely too big . it also had piling right out of the bag . but it is just so soft that i tore the tag off and wore it anyway . if you get this size down for sure ."
__label__-1 "the material is very nice . not flimsy at all which is nice . the problem was the fit around the arms . i am a petite person with a small chest but it still did n't cover me bra . i 'll be returning it ."

__label__0 "this dress is such a beautiful color and the fabric is super soft and lovely . it would be stunning on someone with a slim figure but since i 've got curves/an athletic build it simply did not work . too bad because it is such a pretty dress !"
__label__-1 "this was so boxy and unflattering . i loved the lining and the fabric was very soft but it looked like i was wearing a bag . was hoping to use this as a cute top layer for dresses but it was a terrible fit . sizing down would not help this one . went back !"
__label__0 "i saw this skirt online and went to the store immediately to try on . i was a bit disappointed . the size is tts but the prints were prettier online . the material is ok. the regular is long so probably wo n't look good on a shorter person if it is still available when the price comes down i might buy it ."

__label__-1 "this picture does not represent these jeans .. the color is way off . they are more yellow toned and look much more worn than in the picture . they also run very small ."
__label__-1 "huge bummer . this top is definitely a crop/midi-top . plus it 's cream not white like shown in the photos . i 'm returning it today ."
__label__-1 "the photo misrepresents how large this sweater is . it is giant ! petite ladies stay away from this sweater . i ordered an xs and usually can manage to fit in a regular xs but this just floored me . the neckline would n't even stay up on my upper body it was that loose . also the width of the sweater does not at all hug the body as shows on the model . it is like a tent . i 'm so bummed . the color blue is nice and the sweater is really soft . it 's too bad it does n't fit smaller women ."
__label__1 "this skirt fit but is very body con . if you are not comfortable with such a tight fit consider sizing up . overall the design is beautiful and the fabric is heavy ( hides bumps ) . i plan on ordering one size up hoping that the waist is not too big ."
__label__1 "really nice green blend of colors . fun style but not especially figure flattering as it is a very wide peplum . i still love it and goes with many outfits and as a fall jacket . is a bit itchy . need to wear sleeved top or dress underneath ."
__label__1 "i got this shirt in an xxsp and it has a great slim body . the front ruffle is n't overpowering although i do n't love the ruffles on the sleeves . i think it 's just a little too much but they are n't visible under a sweater or jacket . the length is just right so the shirt can be tucked in or left untucked without looking long and messy . the silk is just a touch sheer but not too see-through . it 's a good shirt ."
__label__1 "i know it 's a bit of a moot point since the chemise has sold out - but on the off chance any come back in stock or if you see one at your local store - i urge you to try it on ! the fabric is incredible . so luxurious . it fits me amazingly . i have a hard time with the whole tight chemise/slip/nightie category of clothing as i 'm fairly skinny but still curvy and while i love my curves i do have a muffin top that can get real awkward when you 're trying to look sexy . this however is a godsend ."
__label__-1 "as soon as i saw this dress i absolutely fell in love with it . when i got it i noticed it was slightly small but figured i could deal with it . i was packing for my vacation and tried it on again just last night and i noticed the bow is coming off the back . i could fix it but honestly a dress should n't start falling apart before you even wear it . it 's cut on the small side . wish i tried the larger one but now it 's sold out . and i was kind of disappointed there were no pockets as pictured . i"

__label__-1 "this skirt for sure was the most disappointing thing i 've ever ordered from retailer . it looks like an all white skirt that has a little stiffness to it but looks are deceiving . it has this weird checkered patten and there is no shape to the skirt at all . there are also weird stitching lines . one more thing that i did n't like about the skirt was that it 's a cream-ish color . not even the cute flamingos will make me keep this skirt . it 's going back ."

__label__0 "so this is a great tee problem is the white you can see through . i an not looking for a layering tee so not what i was looking for ."
__label__1 "i ordered down a size based on other reviews . i am 5 ' tall 110 lbs and a size 26 is a great fit . i ordered both the navy and turquoise colors . my only complaint is the turquoise color is not the vibrant blue in the photo but more of a green tone ."
__label__1 "i saw the orange/tangerine colored version of this sweater and loved it . it looked beautiful on top . the chiffon material at the bottom of the sweater is a lovely detail . sadly the bottom portion of the sweater made my hips look huge and i felt i looked pregnant . i weigh 111lbs . i am petite and small boned . i think it was because i am short waisted that this style did not suit me . i wish i could look good in this ! it is absolutely exquisite in color and texture ."
__label__1 "this chemise is very pretty in person . when i tried it on i was surprised to find that it looks more like a sundress than a chemise . the material is kind of thin but if you wear a nude colored bra underneath it it wo n't show . it looked super cute with a denim jacket on . i took my normal size s and it fits perfectly ( for reference i am 5 ' 2 34b 120lbs ) . i am very happy with this purchase and i ca n't wear it as a chemise a coverup or a hot day sundress . highly recommended !"
__label__0 "i really love the look of this jumpsuit casual but classy . shapely but comfortable . i 'm 5 ' 4 and similar to another reviewer proportional torso to leg ratio . the legs were longer on me than the model in the picture but no problem there because they 're cuffed.however the arm holes are too big . my bra shows and the particular one i got came damaged with some of the embroidery coming unraveled on the back . it 's also supposed to be dry cleaned and that 's annoying for casual wear . returning it ."
__label__1 "i 'm a 0/2 on top with 32d 's and i purchased this top in a medium and it fit perfectly . pretty colors go with a mix of bottoms . design is both functional and attractive which usually is n't the case with swimwear . love the underwire cups adjustable ties and straps . and the fabric is really soft and comfortable ."
__label__0 "the material was a little itchy in my opinion . the fit was pretty big . almost a night shirt . i 'm 5 ' 3 and i will probably only wear this around the house with tights . i got a small . i purchased the orange color online . stay away if you have an olive skin tone ! it 's the pinkish it appears to be on be on the website . i 'm 130 pounds 34d"

__label__0 "loved this top but had to return it . the collar is gorgeous but terrible quality"
__label__-1 "i tried this dress on at my local store and was very disappointed in the slip portion of this dress . there is no give with the slip so even though the dress portion is quite flowy the slip prevents anyone with a large chest or hips to wear this dress ."
__label__-1 "i 'm not really sure what the designer was trying to accomplish with this dress . the fabrics and details are pretty but the shape is really strange . for one thing the dress has a very straight cut so there is not a lot of room for movement and the thin belt makes the shape even worse . i felt like i was wearing a really fancy garbage bag . also the way the bottom flares out is just strange considering the cut and length . i really wanted to like this dress but unfortunately it was a complete miss"
__label__1 "the color is a very dark mustard yellow thin/light-weight material and it has a pretty feminine drape . 0verall a nice twist on a classic plaid shirt . cute cuffs ( complementary design ) . the top was baggier than the bottom though- i deducted a star for the tight fight on the hips . all photos show it unbuttoned or tucked in . i 'm usually between a s/m i recommend the size up for hip fit ."
__label__1 "i bought this dress to wear to a rehearsal dinner . like other reviewers have said it is a true shift dress . i 'm 5 ' 2 114lbs and the 0 fit me like a glove . it was a little hard to get the top on because the bow is not detachable ( wish there was a snap or something ) but once on i was in love . i may have to safety pin my bra to the bow so it does n't show because it kept showing when i tried on . overall a very beautiful dress ."
__label__1 "i love this dress ! my goal is to have a closet full of clothes that are really cute and stylish but are also very comfortable ... this dress fit the bill . the mixture of the fabrics is even more cute in person than it looks online and the fabric is so soft it almost feel like wearing pajamas . the weight of the fabric also makes it hang really nicely and so it 's flattering . overall a great addition to my spring/summer wardrobe ."
__label__1 "the sweater is thinner than i expected but very cute so i 'm keeping it . it seems well made so i 'm not expecting easy snags it washed well ."
__label__1 "this is a perfect outer layer for chilly mornings or nights . the detail on the back and sleeves is definitely retailer quality . the sleeves do run a little long though ."
__label__-1 "i wanted to love this dress because the fabric is fun but i could not find a way to make the drawstring waist look like anything but a potato sack.the model has her hands hiding the lack of a waistline"
__label__0 "this is such a cute top with so much potential soft fabric vibrant colors and flattering fit on top . however like so many of retailer swing tops lately it has tons of fabric at the bottom making it billow in a very unflattering way . i ordered it in an xxsp so i ca n't even go down in size so this top regrettably has to go back . i love swing tops but retailer could we please have tops that do not double for maternity tops ? ?"
__label__0 "i was excited to receive this dress because it seemed like a beautiful breezy dress for summer . unfortunately i did n't find the fit to be very flattering . as two other reviewers mentioned there is too much fabric creating an odd bunching especially at the back waistline . i also found the dress to be a little tight across the bustline upper arms and shoulders . the bunching can be improved by pulling the fabric of the dress forward in the front but this creates more of a plunging neckline than i"
__label__1 "love this top ( and every top tiny puts out ) . runs very small . i normally wear an xs but i got a m in this top . so pretty and great detail"
__label__0 "these ran very small compared to other charlie pants i 've bought in the past . even sizing up the stripes were not flattering . the lady in the next dressing room over tried them on too and had the same feeling i did . the less curvy you are the better stripes look . they more curvy you are the less flattering stripes on pants look . the way the stripes come together at the seams just is n't flattering ."
__label__1 "listen up gals - buy every color before they disappear ! ! ! this top is amazing . so flattering incredible fabric the colors are divine and the price is amazing ! i am not one who wears peplum tops often if ever . a coworker of mine spotted this one in our store and told me as soon as i came in . i 'm curvy - generally a l or xl on top and i have hips and a toosh . peplums can often either sit on my hips in an unflattering way or look like a maternity top on me . this one is magic . hits a big longer"
__label__-1 "first of all this is not pullover styling . there is a side zipper . i would n't have purchased it if i knew there was a side zipper because i have a large bust and side zippers are next to impossible for me . second of all the tulle feels and looks cheap and the slip has an awkward tight shape underneath . not at all what is looks like or is described as . sadly will be returning but i 'm sure i will find something to exchange it for !"
__label__0 "i loved the look of this shirt but full price was a little steep so i waited for it to go on sale and am glad i waited because only a l was left and it was perfect fit since i originally was thinkng of getting a small or medium which i usually do at retailer but this one was running really small compared to retailer other shirts . the fabric is great but when i looked at it carefully the zipper construction is sewn poorly as well as the sewing at the buttons area ... also there were a lot of thread h"
__label__-1 "like another reviewer mentioned this shirt is way too short . i 'm only 5 ' 2 ( xs ) and there is no way this top would tuck in like on the model . also the quality is n't great as it 's very thin and there are strings hanging from some of the seams in the front . it 's a shame b/c the print is really pretty and there is this cute little bicycle charm on the tag which makes it feel more unique . sadly it 's going back !"
__label__-1 "this is much prettier online than on me . too much dress even though i sized down ."
__label__1 "this skirt is a beautiful fabric heavy and soft and fully lined . it has two sets of snaps on the inside so you can adjust the waist size . i purchased a medium but found that there was n't enough of an overlap in the split to be decent ( it flaps open when i walk revealing nearly everything ! ) so i will be exchanging for a large . for reference i typically wear a size 10 or 12 in pants and skirts . the color is true to the photos with a matte finish . i am 5 ' 8 and length hit me below the knee ."
__label__-1 "i wish i had read all the reviews before purchasing . the sweater looked liked everything i would be interested in online . once i pulled it out of the bag my first thought was how could retailer send me a used washed and shrunken sweater . it is nothing like the picture . it fits like a midriff top not exaggerating . i 'm 5.6 ordered the m do n't waste your shipping money on this ."
__label__0 "tried this on and loved it except for one thing -- the sleeves are split so any movement reveals most of your arm shoulders . which also makes it fairly impractical for winter/the office ( yes i could wear a sweater or blazer with it but that defeats the purpose of having an all-purpose cute top . ) why retailer ? this is a perfectly cute top and looks great with jeans etc . but the split sleeves make it a no-go ."
__label__-1 "very cute top but runs very very big ! im5 ft 5 in tall 120 lbs . i ordered the xs but it was so big it looked like a maternity top .. sadly returned the top . otherwise the top was made of good quality fabric ."
__label__-1 "after readying the reviews of this dress i thought for sure i was purchasing a winner . boy was i wrong ! first this dress feels like a potato sack and looked like one on . i felt that it was very boxy and more of a o ' one size fits all ' sizing . it did not embrace my curves at all . the material was not as chic as i would have thought . overall the entire dress was not flattering . honestly i do not understand what the rave reviews were talking about it ."
__label__0 "this top would be great if it were longer and the neck was n't so open . even for a boatneck the neck was too wide . for those that do n't mind showing their stomachs this top will be okay . the material is nice and stretchy and i like the stripes but just way too short for me ."
__label__0 "i wanted to like this top as i usually adore a cute peplum feature . when i tried it on yesterday in the store i was disappointed by how wide and bulky is it . i am petite ( 5 ' 2 110 lbs ) and i tried my usual xs . the fabric was substantial and of a high quality but unfortunately in this design that became a bad thing as the bottom of the shirt balooned out around me . it was very unflattering and i felt lost in the shirt ! definitely try it on for yourself before purchasing ."
__label__-1 "i am normally between a size 0 and 2 so i ordered these pants in both sizes to make sure i would have a nice pair of black crops to wear to work . the 0 seemed pretty tight all around so i returned the 0 and kept the 2 even though there was a little bit of room in the waist . of course the size 2 after a few hours of wearing had completely stretched out was bagging in the crotch area sliding around on my waist and creasing badly behind the knees . i doubt i will wear these pants more than the o"
__label__-1 "i own two poodles and love anything poodle print . i was estatic to see this and i snagged it on sale . but it is horrible . the fit is like wearing a pillowcase . it was about 5 inches too wide on each side while the arms fit . it looked like it was attempting to have a dolman shape but it was way too short wide and wrong . i was in love with the print however i had to return it ."
__label__1 "this is a beautifully designed and made sweater dress . really love it . however there 's no way that model is 5 ' 10 in the photo because i 'm 4 inches shorter than that and the dress is 2 inches shorter on me . it 's really not a dress it 's a tunic . i 'm happy with it because it 's so pretty but i did think i was buying a dress . i just wore it with leggings and i 'm happy with a beautiful tunic !"

__label__-1 "when i ordered this online i should have paid more attention to the picture . the dress comes to the knees of the 5'10 model . i was swimming in small petite size . i checked the label and wondered whether i received the wrong size . nope it was ps . either the dress was mislabeled or this is cut huge . returning . too bad because the shape and color are cute ."

__label__1 "these got me so excited for fall . the teal is a color i 'm really into right now and was the real reason i decided to order these . when they arrived though i was delighted to find that they are light weight and have the perfect amount of stretch . the fit is snug but hugs all the right places and are so comfortable ! these will be a staple in my wardrobe . i want to order more colors !"
__label__-1 "these jeans are adorable ! i 'm so sad they did n't fit . my legs are bigger than the rest of my body but i usually have good luck with wide leg pants . if you are looking for wide legs these are not the jeans for you !"
__label__0 "definitely was disappointed in the fit of this potentially very cute shirt . just too large ; too much fabric for me . i 'm usually an xs and there was just no shape to that size for my small bod . i would n't have minded the longer length if there had been a better fit up top . i think the colors are also a bit duller in person . love the concept though !"
__label__0 "i love the pattern and style of this top . it is a flattering cut however it was way too short . i am 5 ' 6 and small usually fits me without issue . sadly enough i had to return it ."
__label__-1 "in a sea of dresses this is the one that caught my eye in the whole store . i am a pear shape and ended up trying both the medium and the large taking the medium home . it was super flattering on and was an appropriate length to pair with tights . here 's where the problem happened . i wanted to wear this dress for thanksgiving i put it on and as i tightened the drawstring to cinch in the waist - riiiiiiiiiip ! the drawstring ripped through the fabric at the waistband . so disappointed ."

__label__-1 "i was really disappointed when i tried this top on . the design and cut of the neckline is very bulky and just off . the cut of the top overall was just off ."
__label__0 "i 'm all over this trend but this vest is quite thick/poufy and on me i feel like it triangles out and all you see is furball . i love it - but i think you need some height for this to look its best . on me a sweater vest would perhaps be better . i am chesty . but i cant decide . its really cute ! if you 're taller than 5 ' 4 do n't hesitate ."
__label__1 "this top in the remaining blue - green is not the top pictured . it 's like the photos posted in a recent review by inwonderland . the color is deep and beautiful . the neck is high the lace is floral there 's a seam under the bust with a center pleat falling from it . there 's no reason for hesitancy at the sale price ."
__label__1 "it pills a little under the arms and picks up lint but it 's totally worth it . this is a fabulous sweater coat . i receive compliments on it wherever i go . so cozy warm & delicious . not too hot to wear indoors either . it 's breathable . love it . bought in green during black friday sale . highly recommend ."
__label__-1 "the design is very flattering and holiday appropriate . but like many maeve dresses it is absurdly overpriced for the cheap materials used . although figure flattering the zipper is so cheap that -- it runs along the left side -- it bubbles out ruining the sleek look of the bodycon dress . and the rough cheap poly is not worth what they 're asking for it . maybe find this on the sale rack but not at retail"

__label__-1 "this is a very awkward and unflattering shirt . i am very petite -- 90 pounds and 5 ' 2 . the arms fit -- length and width but nothing else about this fit . the scoop was so low and wide that i would require a shirt underneath . it fell exactly like a tent and made a bell shape around my thighs . yikes ! it looks cute on the model but not on me . the material is also very thin and felt sort of like it should be a pajama top ."

__label__0 "i tried on this shirt in the small and the xxs - both were ridiculously wide . they were also both cut really short - the peplum basically started right below my boobs though the small was maybe a little bit longer than the eex . the stripes are really cute the cut is just very strange . for reference the black and white is the small the taupe is the xxs ."
__label__1 "beautifully designed to flatter a women 's figure . i love the fit and feel of this classic but modern cardigan ."

__label__1 "i love this shirt ! red + navy is one of my fave color combos and the vintage feel is fantastic . the fabric is a little thicker and more sweater-like than i was expecting but it 's a good thing . the top is n't heavy but the knit gives it more texture & interest . this is the perfect thing to throw on for a casual sexy look ... covered but form-fitting and flattering ."

__label__-1 "i thought it would be heavier than it is . it 's thin and more delicate than what i would expect for a winter sweater ( it contains wool so not really suitable for spring/summer ) . it 's also shorter than it appears on the model and a little wider/boxier too ."

__label__0 "i like the color and the plaid pattern on this top . the material is soft to the touch and despite being petite i bought the regular length to pair with tights . it has the feel of a baby doll because of the longer length on me . i quite like the feminine cut of the top which makes it slightly unique as far as plaid tops go . the material also does n't feel too flimsy or cheap and the top feels well made . it will not be hard to reach for this item as it is a versatile piece as many reviewers have n"

__label__0 "the stylist had me try this top on off the shoulders but that was kind of snug perhaps why it did n't fit right it is not off the shoulders on this picture . the cut is loose so it looked big on me but going smaller would not have worked the way i had it on ... may give it another try on . xs was big so would need to try the xxs next time . but off the shoulders looked nice on the lady who was smaller built next to me ! colors are nice light but appropriate for fall ( or summer ! ) light fabri"

__label__1 "these jeans are beautiful . as the other reviewers have noted ... they run very large ... like 2 sizes even then they are very stretchy . the embroidery is dark blue ( looks black on screen ) .... lovely pair of jeans . if they had other colors i would by them !"
__label__1 "this is a flattering skirt for work or play . a few things to be aware of : - it is a lightweight knit without a lining ( would travel great and never need ironing ) - the waist is quite high - the waist is quite slim ( people with tummy self-consciousness might feel funny in it ) - the hang is flattering for people with butts and hips ( such as myself ) - true to size for me i decided not to keep it because i could n't come up with enough tops to love it with and because for the money i would"
__label__1 "i buy everything that retailer sells in chambray . this top did not disappoint . it is so comfortable and the back the way it is slightly lower than normal is very sexy without being revealing . the straps fall off of your shoulders a bit but i do not find it annoying . i am not big busted so i did n't have the sizing issue that others seemed to have ."
__label__1 "if i had n't seen the description online i would never have known these pants were navy ! i bought them today and tried them on with a black tunic which looked fantastic . the style is very similar to cartonnier slim pant but the fabric is lighter weight and stretchier . since i 'm heavy around the stomach i will wear the pant with a long tunic top ( to avoid the drumstick look ) which is a shame since the pockets are so cute . the colors in the pants mean that you can match and contrast with a wid"
__label__-1 "agree with other poster . this shirt runs very big . i 'm all for a flowy shirt that hides my belly but this is just a tent . i 'll be retuning it ."

__label__1 "what a perfect summer dress ! after reading the previous review i ordered a size up and it 's perfect . the slip is a little snug on the hips but most dresses are on me so i think on most people it would fit very well as long as you ordered one size larger . i ca n't wait to wear this while traveling through europe next summer !"
